R is a very flexible programming language, which inevitably means there are lots of ways to achieve the same result. This is true of all programming languages, but is particularly exaggerated in R which makes use of ‘meta-programming’. For example, here is how to calculate a new variable using standard R and filter on a variable: # Calculate kilometers per litre from miles per gallon mtcars$kpl &lt;- mtcars$mpg * 0.425144 # Select cars with a horsepower greater than 250 &amp; show only mpg and kpl columns mtcars[mtcars$hp &gt; 250, c(&quot;car&quot;, &quot;mpg&quot;, &quot;kpl&quot;)] car mpg kpl Ford Pantera L 15.8 6.717275 Maserati Bora 15.0 6.377160 Here’s the same thing using Tidyverse style R: mtcars %&gt;% # Calculate kilometers per litre dplyr::mutate( kpl = mpg * 0.425144 ) %&gt;% # Filter cars with a horsepower greater than 250 dplyr::filter( hp &gt; 250 ) %&gt;% # Take only the car, mpg, and newly created kpl columns dplyr::select(car, mpg, kpl) car mpg kpl Ford Pantera L 15.8 6.717275 Maserati Bora 15.0 6.377160 These coding styles are quite different. As people write more code across the Department, it will become increasingly important that code can be handed over to other R users. It is much easier to pick up code written by others if it uses the same coding style you are familiar with. This is the main motivation for this book, to establish a way of coding that represents a sensible default for those who are new to R that is readily transferable across DfT. 1.1 Coding standards Related to this, the Data Science team maintain a coding standards document, that outlines some best practices when writing R code. This is not prescriptive and goes beyond the scope of this document, but might be useful for managing your R projects. 1.2 Adding to the book This book is not static - new chapters can be added and current chapters can be amended.
